DAY 1 (2 hours)

* Sketch out design and functionality of app
* Rough outline of project technical components

DAY 2 (2 hours)

* Set up github repo
* Set up toolchain
* Django boilerplate
* CHECKPOINT: First commit to github

DAY 3 (1 hour)

* Get the first schema and view working from Django REST Framework
* Achieved! Only took an hour :)
* And also solved some minor bugs
* CHECKPOINT: Can call first API endpoint locally through browser

DAY 4 (2 hours)

* Refactor to class-based views per the Django REST Framework tutorial (why didn't they just say that from the beginning...)
* Manually retest in the browser and everything works - same place as I was on Day 3, just refactored.
* Annoyed with manual testing - seems like a good time to write a unit test suite. So I did.
* CHECKPOINT: Test suite passes locally for 3 API endpoints

NEXT
* TODO: Add models for ReadingCelticCross, CardImage, User
* TODO: Write views for modifying the above
* TODO: Add user auth as I'm doing the above - if it makes sense
* Goal: Get all of the API endpoints working locally
* Goal: Write test suite to cover all the API endpoints
* Goal: Deploy and able to call API endpoints from non-local server
