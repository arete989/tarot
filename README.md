DAY 1 (2 hours)

* Sketch out structure of app
* Rough outline of project timeline

DAY 2 (2 hours)

* Set up github repo
* Set up toolchain
* Django boilerplate
* First commit

DAY 3 (1 hour)

* Target: Get the first schema and view working from Django REST framework
* Achieved! Only took an hour :)
* And also solved some minor bugs

DAY 4 (2 hours)

* Refactor to class-based views per the Django REST Framework tutorial (why didn't they just say that from the beginning...)
* Manually retest and everything works - same place as I was on Day 3
* Annoyed with manual testing - this is good time to write a unit test suite. So I did.

NEXT
* TODO: Add models for Reading, Image, User
* TODO: Write views for modifying the above
* TODO: Add user auth as I'm doing the above - if it makes sense
* Goal: Get all of the API endpoints working locally
* Goal: Write test suite to cover all the API endpoints
* Goal: Deploy and able to call API endpoints from non-local server
